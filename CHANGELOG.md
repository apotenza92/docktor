# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file (stable and beta releases share this one changelog).

## [Unreleased]

- Ongoing development.

## [v0.3.1]

- Fixed stale App Exposé tracking so same-app active Dock clicks reset cleanly after inactivity, while the dismissal state now expires based on the latest real interaction instead of a fixed timer.
- Refreshed the stable and beta app icons with the new filled leaf treatment and updated the matching website icon exports.
- Replaced the menu bar leaf with a new filled SVG-derived glyph and tuned its sizing for clearer 16-18pt menu bar legibility.

## [v0.3.0]

- Fixed the shipped `Shift+Option+click` quit path so consumed modifier clicks now intercept on mouse-down instead of leaving the Dock press alive long enough to open the Dock item context menu.
- Restored the internal click-action lookup used by Dockmint's double-click preservation and consumed-click timing paths, and added decision coverage for the consumed modifier click watchdog behavior.

## [v0.2.9]

- Reverted the experimental cross-space and App Exposé work back to the stable `v0.2.8` baseline.
- Changed the shipped default for app Dock icon `Shift+Option+click` to `Quit App` for fresh installs and Reset App Actions to Defaults.

## [v0.2.8]

- Reissued the onboarding and single-click App Exposé update after fixing Swift 6 actor-isolation build failures that blocked CI and signed release packaging for the `v0.2.7` tag.
- Refreshed the GUI automation fixtures to rely on built-in macOS apps only, using Finder for 1-window Dock checks and TextEdit/Safari for multi-window coverage while forcing real separate windows even when the host prefers tabs.
- Revalidated the shipped defaults and focused App Exposé flows with the refreshed built-in GUI suites, including default-install checks, active-app App Exposé stress, and the Dock context-menu guard.

## [v0.2.7]

- Reworked first-run setup into a single-screen onboarding flow with direct permission guidance, weekly background update checks enabled by default, a gated `Finish Setup` action, and a short post-setup menu bar icon confirmation instead of dropping new installs straight into Settings.
- Simplified app icon behavior around a single-click model: App Actions now center on `Click`, shipped app defaults use `App Exposé (>1 window only)` for no-modifier click, `Hide Others` for Shift-click, `Hide Current, Activate Clicked` for Option-click, and no default app-icon scroll actions.
- Improved App Exposé responsiveness and reliability on the shipped click path by making both inactive first-click and active-app single-click triggers zero added delay, removing the ultra-fast dismiss grace hold, and hardening same-app dismiss / tracking behavior during rapid Dock interaction.
- Cleaned up Settings and app presentation with the new onboarding window, reduced development-build-only messaging to the essentials, refreshed current-facing action labels/copy, and updated the filled menu bar leaf icon.
- Separated development identity behavior from release installs more cleanly, including safer instance management, launch handling, settings-opening behavior, and persistent log locations under `~/Library/Logs/Dockmint` / `~/Library/Logs/Dockmint Dev`.
- Refreshed automated coverage for the modern interaction model with new default-install, click-behavior, Dock context-menu guard, settings-open stability, and App Exposé stress checks while removing stale double-click-focused suites.

## [v0.2.6]

- Made Dock icon double-click actions run only on a real macOS double click, so single clicks on an already-frontmost app no longer trigger the mapped double-click action.
- Updated the shipped defaults so first click uses `App Exposé (>1 window only)` while double click opens `App Exposé`, removed the default no-modifier app and folder scroll actions, made Option-click on folders open Finder with `System` view, and refreshed the README, website, and Settings copy to match.
- Shortened the Settings window default size, kept vertical resizing enabled with fixed width, made local Debug builds open Settings automatically on launch, and targeted the built app directly in local settings URL checks so installed Dockmint-family apps are not pulled into dev workflows.

## [v0.2.5]

- Fixed the folder-click regression where Dockmint could move the mouse cursor or feel stuck while handling Dock folder clicks.
- Reverted the default no-modifier folder click action back to `Dock` so plain clicks once again follow native Dock folder behavior by default.
- Simplified Finder opening for non-default folder actions by removing the problematic existing-window probe from the click path.
- Renamed the automatic Finder view label from `Finder Default (Preserve State)` to `System` in Folder Actions.

## [v0.2.4]

- Changed the default plain Dock folder-stack click action to Finder passthrough (`Open With = Finder`, `View = Finder Default`) so fresh installs and Reset Folder Actions preserve Finder’s own remembered window, view, group, and sort state.
- Added a one-time migration that rewrites only the exact legacy plain-click default (`Dock` + automatic view, no group/sort overrides) to the new Finder passthrough default, leaving intentional custom folder actions untouched.
- Clarified Folder Actions settings copy so Finder Default is explicitly presented as Finder-managed behavior, while explicit Finder view/group/sort selections remain available as Dockmint-controlled overrides.
- Added folder-action decision coverage and extra debug diagnostics around folder-click hit detection, pending-state lifecycle, neutral mouse-up recovery, and executor route selection.
- Hardened Finder-default folder clicks so delayed synthetic release events no longer wipe newer in-flight clicks, missed folder mouse-ups can be recovered by a watchdog, plain Finder-default clicks now reuse an already-open Finder window for that folder instead of reopening it, and fresh-open stress testing now passes reliably.
- Added a documented multi-release Docktor -> Dockmint rollout runbook plus release-time validation for migration phase, legacy appcast mirroring, and canonical `apotenza92/dockmint` release origin checks.

## [v0.2.3]

- Cut over the shipped stable and beta app identities to the final Dockmint bundle identifiers, `pzc.Dockmint` and `pzc.Dockmint.beta`, while keeping one overlap release of legacy Docktor feed mirroring and Homebrew aliases for existing installs.
- Switched cleanup-phase packaged update feeds to the canonical `apotenza92/dockmint` appcasts so post-migration Dockmint builds no longer point at the legacy Docktor repository.
- Fixed GitHub release appcast signing to use Sparkle's native `sign_update` tool, restoring compatibility with legacy exported Sparkle signing-key formats during automated releases.

## [v0.2.2]

- Published the Dockmint stable transition release so existing `Docktor` installs can update in place to Dockmint branding before the later bundle-identifier cleanup release.
- Kept stable and beta updater continuity on the legacy `Docktor` Sparkle feed while allowing beta users to converge back onto the newer stable release when no newer beta is available.
- Updated the download page stable theme colors to match the current Dockmint app icon palette.

## [v0.2.2-beta.2]

- Reissued the Dockmint beta as the planned transition build so existing `Docktor Beta` installs can upgrade in place before the later bundle-identifier cleanup release.
- Kept the Dockmint branding and beta release channel while restoring update compatibility for legacy `pzc.Dockter.beta` installs.
- Corrected the GitHub release configuration to use the original Dockmint Sparkle signing key for future appcast publication.

## [v0.2.2-beta.1]

- Restored Dockmint beta release continuity after the repository rename by publishing the beta channel from the live `apotenza92/dockmint` repo and aligning release metadata with Dockmint bundle/update paths.
- Fixed updater continuity for Dockmint installs so beta appcasts and release downloads resolve under the Dockmint repo instead of dead pre-rename URLs.
- Simplified the app icon and menu bar icon back to the plain Lucide leaf geometry to remove the flipped/skewed leaf rendering.

## [v0.2.1]

- Polished the single-window Settings layout with tighter top-column balancing, clearer section hierarchy, compact permissions rows, and action-table sizing tweaks that remove truncation in common controls.
- Cleaned up update messaging in Settings by showing the short version only and mapping Sparkle "no update found" and cancelled checks to user-friendly status text.
- Restricted duplicate-instance termination to Debug builds so release builds no longer interfere with Sparkle relaunch/update flows.

## [v0.2.0]

- Redesigned Settings into a single compact scrollable window with inline section headers, right-aligned reset actions, richer update status text, and expanded Folder Actions controls.
- Added configurable folder-stack click and scroll actions, including Dock passthrough, Finder opening with view/group/sort options, and custom “Open With” app targets with async app-list warming.
- Improved settings responsiveness with instrumented internal timing logs, fixed pane sizing, shared settings services, and a local benchmark harness for reproducible settings timing runs.
- Hardened Dock hit testing and gesture routing with folder Dock item detection, alternate-axis scroll handling, and drag-path changes that preserve native Dock drag/reorder/drop behavior while reducing drag-start stutter.
- Improved launch/runtime robustness across Docktor-family installs, update-state reporting, and macOS 14 compatibility by removing deprecated activation calls and tightening main-actor isolation around workspace/private-window APIs.
- Added coverage and tooling updates for the new Dock hit-test and scroll decision paths, plus Xcode-aware Debug app resolution in shared test helpers and developer docs.

## [v0.1.2]

- Fixed modifier-click timing so modifier double-click actions no longer get swallowed by the first modifier click, while single-click modifier actions still execute correctly after the system double-click interval.
- Restored reliable modifier toggle behavior for `Hide Others` and `Hide App`, including second-click undo/show-all handling and target-only unhide for `Hide App`.
- Added `scripts/automated_modifier_toggle_checks.sh` to cover real Dock GUI regressions for modifier single-click and double-click action interactions.

## [v0.1.1]

- Added a public macOS download page with stable/beta channel switching, Apple Silicon/Intel selection, direct GitHub release downloads, and matching Homebrew install commands.
- Refreshed project marketing across the download page, README, and GitHub metadata to describe Docktor as customizable Dock click, double-click, and scroll actions, including the shipped default of double click opening App Exposé to show an app's open windows.
- Updated the download page branding so stable/beta copy, icon swapping, and icon-derived accent colors stay aligned with the selected channel.

## [v0.1.0]

- Fixed the default `activateApp -> active-app action` double-click path for `Hide App`, `Hide Others`, `Single App Mode`, `Minimize All`, and `Quit App`, including Mail-specific hide fallback handling and stale first-click recovery.
- Clarified the README defaults so the intended baseline behavior is “double click an app icon to open App Expose” for that app.
- Added broader Dock-click regression coverage, including the new active-click soak runner plus harness fixes for pinned fixtures, repeated `minimizeAll` setup, and stable fixture-pool pair selection.

## [v0.0.39]

- Changed the shipped defaults so `Show menu bar icon` starts enabled, `Show settings on startup` stays off after the first run, and `Start Docktor Beta at login` remains off by default.
- Removed the development-only preference overrides that forced the menu bar icon and startup settings window on, so local builds now match the shipped app behavior.
- Added a settings-shell regression that verifies first launch opens settings once and subsequent launches stay closed when `showOnStartup` is disabled.

## [v0.0.38-beta.1]

- Fixed beta branding so the settings window, status item accessibility label, and menu item labels use the bundle product name consistently (`Docktor Beta` for beta builds).
- Updated remaining settings copy that referenced the stable app name so beta builds no longer show mixed `Docktor`/`Docktor Beta` strings.

## [v0.0.38]

- Fixed settings-window and menu bar labeling to use the bundle product name consistently, so beta builds show `Docktor Beta` instead of mixed stable/beta naming.
- Updated remaining settings copy that referenced the stable app name so beta builds no longer show mixed `Docktor`/`Docktor Beta` strings.

## [v0.0.37]

- Fixed default active-app App Exposé bounce-out by removing mouse-down pre-triggering and enforcing mouse-up pass-through trigger ordering.
- Added rapid second-click promotion logic for default `first click = Activate App` flows so quick double-clicks can still execute mapped active-click actions (including App Exposé) using macOS double-click timing.
- Added and hardened double-click regression harnesses (`automated_default_active_app_expose_double_click.sh`, `automated_default_active_click_double_click_generic.sh`) plus shared click-hold support in `scripts/lib/test_common.sh`.

## [v0.0.36]

- Fixed intermittent Dock icon hang/context-menu regressions on the default `activateApp -> active-app App Exposé` path by hardening click lifecycle recovery in `DockExposeCoordinator` and `DockClickEventTap`.
- Added explicit stale Exposé tracking expiry/cleanup and deferred active-click `App Exposé` triggering safeguards to prevent collapsed or missed invokes during repeated cycles.
- Added `scripts/automated_default_active_app_expose_stress.sh` for deterministic real Dock-click stress validation of the default active-app App Exposé workflow.

## [v0.0.35]

- Fixed an App Exposé regression where the active-app second-click transition could begin and then immediately collapse again because Dock pressed-state recovery posted a synthetic release into the Exposé animation window.
- Tightened the local multi-Space App Exposé harness so it re-establishes the active-app precondition without reintroducing a focus race before the second click.

## [v0.0.34]

- Added Space-aware AX/CG window filtering for window actions, including private window-to-Space lookup and stronger AX-to-CG window identity matching for current-Space `Minimize All` and `Bring All to Front`.
- Fixed active-app second-click consistency for `Hide App`, `Hide Others`, `Minimize All`, and `Quit App`, including preventing Dock release recovery from relaunching apps after `Quit App`.
- Hardened the local regression harnesses for settings and multi-Space Brave checks so release validation covers the new active-app and cross-Space behavior more reliably.

## [v0.0.33]

- Fixed the menu bar icon rendering path to redraw as a template image per display scale, so the glyph stays sharp when moving between non-Retina external displays and Retina MacBook panels.

## [v0.0.32]

- Improved mixed-device scroll direction resolution by preferring AppKit-interpreted deltas (what apps actually receive) and adding conflict handling for disagreeing CGEvent scroll fields.
- Added `scripts/automated_scroll_direction_checks.sh` for deterministic GUI-level scroll routing checks (discrete + continuous events on real Dock icon targets), and wired it into `scripts/run_all_checks.sh`.
- Improved automatic mixed-device handling: discrete mouse-wheel routing now auto-inverts when remapper heuristics (e.g. Mos/LinearMouse/UnnaturalScrollWheels detection) indicate mouse-only direction remapping, while trackpad/Magic Mouse routing remains unchanged.
- Fixed issue #1 follow-up: prevented delayed Dock context-menu popups after second-click `Minimize All` by using action-aware pressed-state recovery for consumed minimize clicks.

## [v0.0.31]

- Refreshed automation reliability to prevent opaque "operation aborted" runs: shared preflight checks, dynamic Debug app discovery, deterministic app selection, and explicit startup/readiness health checks in `scripts/lib/test_common.sh`.
- Hardened App Exposé runtime state handling under rapid churn by confirming invocation evidence before committing tracking state, plus explicit rollback/reset when invocation is unconfirmed.
- Improved event-tap timeout recovery and reduced debug logging pressure to avoid stale/latching interaction state after tap timeout conditions.

## [v0.0.30]

- Fixed Sparkle feed URL injection for packaged builds by parameterizing `SUFeedURL` in `Docktor/Info.plist` (`$(SU_FEED_URL)`) and overriding it per release matrix entry.
- Beta artifacts now embed the Beta appcast URL directly (`beta-arm64` / `beta-x64`), ensuring Beta users receive the Beta track (which already advances to newer stable versions when they surpass prereleases).

## [v0.0.29]

- Fixed release packaging so Sparkle feed URLs are channel+architecture-specific at build time (`stable-arm64`, `stable-x64`, `beta-arm64`, `beta-x64`) instead of a single hardcoded stable feed.
- Ensured Beta app builds consistently follow the Beta appcast track, which already promotes newer stable releases when they are newer than prereleases.

## [v0.0.28]

- Fixed App Exposé state cleanup after dismiss so switching to a different app from the Dock works on the first click instead of intermittently requiring a second click.
- Hardened first-click `Activate App` pass-through by asserting Dock-driven activation when needed, improving reliability after App Exposé close/dismiss flows.

## [v0.0.27]

- Fixed a Sparkle relaunch regression where `Install and Relaunch` could fail to reopen the app if a Finder-style relaunch (`-psn_`) was incorrectly treated as a settings-handoff launch.
- Restricted running-instance settings handoff to explicit `--settings` launches only, while preserving "click app icon to open Settings" behavior for normal Finder/Dock launches.

## [v0.0.26]

- Restored settings discoverability for background-only launches: opening Docktor from Applications/Dock now reliably opens the settings window, including when another Docktor instance is already running.
- Added a running-instance handoff for explicit settings opens so duplicate launches request settings in the existing process, then exit cleanly.
- Auto-restores menu bar icon visibility when settings are explicitly requested (reopen/URL/Finder launch), so users always have a visible way back to settings.

## [v0.0.25]

- Fixed mixed-device scroll direction handling by preferring discrete wheel delta fields for non-continuous mouse events, improving compatibility with per-device remappers like UnnaturalScrollWheels.

## [v0.0.24]

- Reduced rapid App Exposé double-click conflicts by consuming immediate no-window follow-up clicks after first-click activation.
- Matched the no-window App Exposé suppression grace to macOS `NSEvent.doubleClickInterval` for user-consistent timing.
- Added a tiny App Exposé dismiss grace window to avoid accidental instant dismiss on ultra-fast repeat clicks.

## [v0.0.24-beta.1]

- Reduced rapid App Exposé double-click conflicts by consuming immediate no-window follow-up clicks after first-click activation.
- Matched the no-window App Exposé suppression grace to macOS `NSEvent.doubleClickInterval` for user-consistent timing.
- Added a tiny App Exposé dismiss grace window to avoid accidental instant dismiss on ultra-fast repeat clicks.

## [v0.0.23]

- Updated defaults: first click now defaults to `Activate App`, while active-app click stays `App Exposé` with `>1 window only` OFF by default.
- Simplified the action table UI by moving App Exposé gating into picker options (`App Exposé` / `App Exposé (>1 window only)`) for all slots and returning the table to single-row cells.
- Improved scroll direction handling to follow effective per-device event direction (including remappers like LinearMouse) instead of global-only natural-scroll preference.
- Added a GitHub mark button next to `About` in settings and refreshed README default-behavior documentation.
- Standardized Hide toggles so re-running `Hide App` or `Hide Others` now undoes hidden state via `Show All`.

## [v0.0.22]

- Restored first-click default/reset behavior to `App Exposé`.
- Added compatibility migration + legacy fallback seeding for per-slot App Exposé `>1 window only` gates (from legacy first-click/active-click preferences).
- Aligned scroll up/down routing with macOS Natural vs Standard scrolling mode and added unit coverage for both mappings.
- Hardened settings shell automation with menu-bar count wait/retry and made `scripts/release.sh` run required pre-tag validation by default (waiver now requires an issue reference).

## [v0.0.21]

- Fixed Allen-reported Dock regression cases: wrong-target/finicky `Hide App` behavior and swallowed third click during repeated App Exposé clicks.
- Added per-slot `>1 window only` App Exposé gating for modifier rows and scroll mappings, with matching settings UI toggles and preference persistence.
- Hardened App Exposé click-path state handling when the clicked app is already active while Exposé tracking is in progress.

## [v0.0.20]

- Reworked the top settings layout into three columns (`General`, `Updates`, `Permissions`) with updated control grouping and wording, including `Active App Click` in the mappings table header.
- Switched permission info indicators to native macOS help tooltips on the `(i)` controls, with a larger hover target and faster tooltip reveal timing.
- Improved settings-window behavior by centering first-open placement and persisting/restoring the window frame across launches/updates.
- Added Debug-build guardrails for local testing: disable Sparkle update checks and force menu bar icon visibility/startup settings on.

## [v0.0.19]

- Fixed synthetic Dock click recovery so it no longer posts mouse-up events at offscreen coordinates, preventing visible pointer jumps during actions like `Option+Click` Single App Mode.

## [v0.0.18]

- Replaced SwiftUI `MenuBarExtra` settings routing with an AppKit `NSStatusItem` menu controller to eliminate status-menu reentrancy issues.
- Replaced responder-chain settings opening (`showSettingsWindow:` / `showPreferencesWindow:`) with a dedicated AppKit `NSWindowController` hosting the existing SwiftUI preferences view.
- Fixed a severe post-click CPU runaway (up to 100%) triggered by opening `Settings…` from the menu bar icon on some machines.
- Validated with real pointer clicks (`cliclick`) in repeated menu open flows, including 30-iteration open/click-inside-controls/close stress with no crashes and no high-CPU runaway.

## [v0.0.17]

- Fixed a settings-open crash in the SwiftUI menu flow by removing a recursive `showSettingsWindow:` bridge path in `AppDelegate`.
- Kept settings routing on system actions only (`showSettingsWindow:` / `showPreferencesWindow:`), avoiding self-targeted responder recursion.
- Re-validated settings stability for launch-argument open, URL open, repeated `Cmd+,`, and status-menu `Settings…` clicks.

## [v0.0.16]

- Switched menu-bar settings action to SwiftUI `SettingsLink` on macOS 14+.
- Removed custom fallback settings window presentation and routed settings opening through system settings actions only.
- Bumped deployment target to macOS 14.0 to support the native SwiftUI settings-link flow.
- Verified settings stability with repeated open checks (`Cmd+,`) and settings shell automation.

## [v0.0.15]

- Reworked the menu-bar shell to SwiftUI `MenuBarExtra` and standardized wording to `Settings…`.
- Added menu icon visibility toggle with lockout protection (`showOnStartup` auto-enable when icon is hidden).
- Added settings fail-safes: launch arguments (`--settings`/aliases) and URL handlers (`docktor://settings`, `dockter://settings`).
- Hardened Dock click/App Exposé decision flow and hide behavior reliability for issue #1 regressions.
- Added `DockDecisionEngine` extraction, XCTest target/scheme support, and expanded automated regression scripts.

## [v0.0.14]

- Fixed menu-bar `Preferences…` opening reliability by using a resilient multi-path action handler (`showSettingsWindow:` -> `showPreferencesWindow:` -> in-app fallback window).

## [v0.0.13]

- Fixed status-bar `Preferences…` action routing to use the standard Settings responder path, preventing crashes when opening settings from the menu bar icon.
- Improved Dock click target reliability by re-resolving the Dock icon bundle on mouse-up before executing actions.
- Hardened `Hide App` execution with post-hide verification and fallback paths, fixing intermittent active-app hide behavior.
- Reduced App Exposé state false-positives and removed swallowed-click/third-click no-op regressions in repeated Dock interactions.

## [v0.0.12]

- Split App Expose gating into two independent `>1 window only` settings: one for `First Click` and one for `Active App` (click-after-activation).
- Updated the mappings table UI to surface and center the separate toggles only when each corresponding action is set to `App Expose`.
- Updated README defaults/behavior notes to reflect independent App Expose gating controls.

## [v0.0.11]

- Reduced accidental scroll double-toggles by adding a cooldown guard for toggle-style scroll actions (`Hide App`, `Hide Others`, and `Single App Mode`).

## [v0.0.10]

- Renamed the product, project, release workflows, scripts, and repository from `Dockter` to `Docktor`.
- Kept existing bundle identifiers (`pzc.Dockter` / `pzc.Dockter.beta`) so existing Sparkle users continue to upgrade in place.
- Added launch-time migration that renames legacy installs (`DockActioner.app` and `Dockter.app`) to `Docktor.app` in `/Applications`.
- Updated release automation and Sparkle appcast tooling for the new repository slug and `Docktor` artifact/cask names.

## [v0.0.9]

- Fixed Single App Mode so switching apps hides only the app you are leaving, then shows/activates the app you click.
- Extended the `>1 window only` App Expose preference to also apply to the "Click after App activation" App Expose path.
- Fixed Brave vertical-tabs compatibility so sidebar/auxiliary panes are excluded from window counts used by first-click App Expose and `>1 window only`.
- Improved first-click App Expose fallback behavior and tracing around mouse-down/up window-state decisions.
- Simplified settings-window presentation to use the fallback preferences window path directly.
- Simplified and refreshed README documentation, including the app icon and streamlined install/build/release guidance.
- Updated CI workflow references from legacy `DockActioner` names to `Docktor` project/scheme/product identifiers.

## [v0.0.8]

- Added a focused App Expose cartesian harness profile (Finder + TextEdit) with machine-readable artifacts and deterministic scenario IDs for gate/cancel reliability testing.
- Hardened Dock click targeting in cartesian runs with cached/revalidated icon points and per-click down/up bundle probes to distinguish hit-test misses from trigger failures.
- Fixed negative-space cancel tracking reset so consumed/non-Dock clicks clear App Expose tracking state correctly and reduce stuck cancel flows.
- Added recovery for consumed click-up paths by posting passthrough synthetic mouse-up events, reducing Dock icons getting visually stuck in a pressed/greyed state.

## [v0.0.7]

- Fixed first-click App Expose interception so when `>1 window only` is off, repeated first clicks on running apps continue dispatching App Expose instead of falling back to Dock activation.
- Added/validated automated first-click and App Expose re-entry regression coverage for this flow.

## [v0.0.6]

- Fixed App Expose re-entry handling so clicking a Dock icon after selecting a window from App Expose reliably triggers "Click after App activation" actions.
- Added a dedicated App Expose re-entry regression suite that reproduces picker-selection then same-icon re-click behavior and verifies App Expose dispatch.
- Hardened action test dispatch timing to avoid retry-induced toggle flakiness in `click hideOthers`.

## [v0.0.5]

- Updated defaults so first click (no modifier) uses App Expose with the "requires multiple windows" safeguard enabled.
- Updated "Reset mappings to defaults" to restore the same first-click App Expose behavior.

## [v0.0.4]

- Fixed first-click App Expose reliability by aligning click interception with down/up event pairs so Dock icons no longer get stuck pressed.
- Reworked App Expose activation flow to use a single-shot trigger with activation-state coordination, removing jumpy re-entry/cancel loops.
- Improved App Expose focus handoff so switching between apps while Expose is open correctly activates the newly selected app when exiting.
- Added a dedicated first-click App Expose automated suite that validates both dispatch and on-screen Expose evidence across repeated iterations.

## [v0.0.3]

- Added native Sparkle updater integration with an in-app "Check for Updates" flow and configurable update check frequency in Settings.
- Added signed Sparkle appcasts for stable/beta and arm64/x64, with release automation that regenerates and publishes appcasts from GitHub releases.
- Unified release notes to a single `CHANGELOG.md` source used by both GitHub Releases and Sparkle update descriptions.
- Improved first-run permission prompting for Accessibility and Input Monitoring and refreshed the compact settings layout with a table-based mapping editor.
- Added a no-op (`-`) action option, updated modifier defaults (`Shift+Click` -> Bring All to Front), and a "Reset mappings to defaults" control.

## [v0.0.2]

- Added full per-modifier action mapping with a table-style settings UI and new Single App Mode action.
- Fixed Preferences opening from the status menu and simplified menu actions to Preferences + Quit.
- Refined app and status-bar iconography, including a separate beta app icon set and larger menu bar glyph.
- Added side-by-side beta distribution support (`Docktor Beta.app`) across CI, release packaging, and Homebrew casks.

## [v0.0.1]

- Added Dock notification based App Expose triggering for reliable behavior.
- Updated defaults: click -> App Expose, scroll down -> Hide App.
- Refined settings UI layout and removed diagnostics from standard settings surface.
- Added tag-driven release automation with signing, notarization, and Homebrew tap updates.
